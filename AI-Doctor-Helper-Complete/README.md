# AI Doctor Helper for Windows

This project is a fully-featured Windows application that provides AI-powered healthcare diagnostics, imaging analysis, and secure patient management. It integrates MONAI bundles, Hugging Face datasets, signal-based ECG models, and federated learning using NVFLARE.

## Key Features

- Electron-based UI (Vue.js) for cross-platform performance and responsiveness.
- AI-powered imaging analysis using MONAI pre-trained and fine-tuned models.
- Signal-based diagnostics via ECG and echocardiography models.
- Secure patient data storage and audit logging meeting HIPAA compliance.
- Federated learning capabilities for privacy-preserving model updates.
- Complete modular structure allowing for easy extension to other modalities, such as pathology or dermatology.

## Dependencies

- Node.js v20+
- Conda (for Python environment)
- Python 3.10
- Electron 27
- MONAI and NVFLARE
